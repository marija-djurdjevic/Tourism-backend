# PSW Travel
## Overview
This is a web application designed to connect tour creators in Novi Sad with users interested in guided tours. The platform allows guides to create and publish tours, while users can purchase them and navigate through key locations using the app.

The project was developed as part of the PSW course by a team of 14 students. A key feature of the application is its ability to manage the full lifecycle of tours—from creation, through publishing, to guiding users efficiently from one location to another. 

## My Contributions
During the development of the backend, I worked on several core functionalities, including:

+ Key point management – Enabling tour creators to add important locations to their tours.

+ Tour lifecycle management – Calculating the total distance and estimated time required to complete it.

+ Live tours feature – Together with my colleague Jana Janković, I introduced a new segment to the application: free live tours conducted with a guide in real-time. Every registered user gets one free live tour as an incentive to later purchase full tours.

+ Encounters module –  Together with my colleague Jana Janković, I introduced a new module called Encounters, which allows users to participate in interactive challenges of various types, enhancing engagement and gamifying the experience.

+ Backend development & testing – Implementing business logic and writing automated tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the system.

## Technologies Used
The backend of the application is built using:

+ ASP.NET – Web application framework

+ PostgreSQL – Database management system (with pgAdmin for administration)

+ Entity Framework – Object-relational mapper (ORM)

+ AutoMapper – Library for mapping DTOs to domain objects and vice versa

+ xUnit – Testing framework for automated tests

+ .NET 7 – Required runtime environment

## Project Methodology
The project was developed using Scrum, an agile development methodology. The team worked in sprints, holding regular sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to ensure continuous progress and improvement. This approach allowed us to be flexible and adaptive throughout the development process, ensuring that the app meets both functional and user expectations.
